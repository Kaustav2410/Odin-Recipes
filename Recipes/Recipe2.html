                <h3>Description</h3>
                <p>Fresh tomatoes and a rich, cheesy filling make a summertime savory pie. There is a lot of preparation for this pie, but it is well worth every minute. I love this pie on summer mountain evenings. Enjoy with cool ice tea.</p>

                <h3>Steps</h3>
                <dl>
                    <dt>Step 1</dt>
                    <dd>Chill pie dough for about 1 hour.</dd>
                    <dt>Step 2</dt>
                    <dd>Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Place a baking sheet on the lower oven rack.</dd>
                    <dt>Step 3</dt>
                    <dd>Slice heirloom tomatoes into 1/2-inch rounds. Remove seeds with your fingers. Place 6 slices on paper towels or a clean cloth and cover with more paper towels or another clean cloth. Arrange the remaining slices on a wire rack. Cut Roma tomatoes into 1/2-inch slices, remove seeds, and arrange them on the rack as well.</dd>
                    <dt>Step 4</dt>
                    <dd>Line a deep-dish, 9-inch pie plate with dough. Place 2 layers of aluminum foil over the entire surface. Fill with pie weights or dried beans.</dd>
                    <dt>Step 5</dt>
                    <dd>Bake pie crust on the preheated baking sheet on the bottom rack. Place tomatoes on a higher rack. Reduce temperature to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Bake until the bottom of the pie crust has lost its translucent raw look and the edges have just started to color, 12 to 15 minutes.</dd>
                    <dt>Step 6</dt>
                    <dd>Carefully remove the foil and the weights. Cover the edges of the crust with foil to prevent them from burning. Poke the bottom of the pie crust with a fork to keep it from puffing up. Return the pie crust to the bottom rack and bake until the bottom starts to color, about 8 more minutes.</dd>
                    <dt>Step 7</dt>
                    <dd>Remove pie crust and allow to cool. Continue baking the tomatoes until they are wilted, about 40 minutes total. Remove and allow to cool. Keep the oven on.</dd>
                    <dt>Step 8</dt>
                    <dd>Place bacon in a large skillet and cook over medium-high heat, turning occasionally, until some of the fat has rendered, about 5 minutes. Add sliced leek. Cook until bacon is crisp and the leeks have softened and browned, about 5 more minutes. Drain bacon on paper towels and allow to cool.</dd>
                    <dt>Step 9</dt>
                    <dd>Place bacon-leek mixture, Cheddar, Fontina, mayonnaise, basil, egg, and mustard in a bowl. Season with salt and pepper. Mix to combine.</dd>
                    <dt>Step 10</dt>
                    <dd>Spread 1/3 mixture on the bottom of the pie crust. Arrange 1/2 of the roasted tomatoes on top, overlapping heirlooms with Roma tomatoes. Spread another 1/3 of the mixture over the tomatoes and arrange the remaining roasted tomatoes on top. Add the last 1/3 of the mixture and gently press the fresh tomato slices on top in a decorative pattern. Arrange foil around the edges of the pie crust to protect them from burning, taking care that the foil doesn't touch the tomatoes.</dd>
                    <dt>Step 11</dt>
                    <dd>Bake until browned and bubbly on top, about 40 minutes. Cool completely before serving.</dd>
